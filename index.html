    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...
      It was raining cats and dogs.
      Something happened. The internet went out.
      A helpful Launchcode student pulled out his cell phone and said, "Don't worry, I got this."
      Of course, this was after the Teaching Fellows told us
      "Don't worry, we got this."
